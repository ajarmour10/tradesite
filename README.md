# TradeSite

Simple dealership trade‑in value estimator website.

## Overview

This project now includes multiple pages inspired by popular car appraisal sites. The home page introduces the dealership and links to pages for a trade‑in estimator, inventory and contact information. The estimator uses client‑side JavaScript to provide a basic value based on mileage and condition keywords.

The estimate is for demonstration purposes only and does not represent a real offer.

## Running Locally

No build step is required. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser or serve the files via a static web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
