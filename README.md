# TradeSite

Simple dealership trade-in value estimator website.

## Overview

This project provides a single-page website that allows users to enter a VIN, mileage and a short description of the vehicle's condition. A client-side script then produces an estimated trade-in value using a very basic formula.

The estimate is for demonstration purposes only and does not represent a real offer.

## Running Locally

No build step is required. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser or serve the files via a static web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
